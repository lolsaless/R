Final example in grid appendix should be
p <- qplot(wt, mpg, data=mtcars, colour=cyl)
grob <- ggplotGrob(p)
grob2 <- geditGrob(grob, gPath("legend.text"), gp=gpar(fontface = "bold"))
grid.newpage()
grid.draw(grob2)

In figure 3.8 on page 38, the figure label says that small values occur at the bottom of the scales. But in the figure they do not, e.g. 2 is shown at the top and 10 at the bottom.

Appendix B
Caption to Fig B1, something is wrong

Chap 10
p177-8 Interactive zooming would be so much better!

Chap 9
Figs 9.1 and 9.2 are claimed to be the same, but they are not.

The two plots in Fig 9.2 are supposed to have the same predictions, but do not.

Fig 9.5 (right) is not nearly as good as 9.5 (left) for the purpose.  How would you handle lags?  Did you ever see Graham Wills' Diamond Fast for interactive time series graphics?

§9.2.2 Not a great pcp example.  Would prefer examples where the plot tells us something and is chosen for that reason.  What do the pcp's here tell us?

Fig 6.1 p95 "What does it eat?"  There is no legend entry for insecti

p72 (jittered figures) Fig 5.5 is not nice

p75 Fig 5.9 seems to me misleading, better to stick with the raw data resolution
Or at least say more about what you are trying to achieve (simulating the likely variability)

p79  Shouldn't cities be shown in the righthand plot?

p79 Does the US look like this?! (Figs 5.12, 5.13)

From Karl Ove Hufthammer ------------------------------------------
On page 162-163, there are shown four plots; let's call them A, B, C and D.
B should be identical to C, except for the confidence ribbons. However, both the x and y axes differ.
D should be identical to to B (and to C plus confidence limits). But D looks very different. For example, the peak in B and C lies under the other lines in D. And the axes are also slightly different from B.

I don't know anything about viewports but it seems strange that the upperleft and bottomright panels are both _2_1, should one be _1_2?

Rob Baer ---------------------------------------------------------------------

p100 Figure 6.4 legend.  I think the reference to the left and right graphs is reversed.
p. 116 line 17 reads, "cation (e.g., x~y) ...";  consider instead "cation (e.g., y~x) ...";
p. 135, fig 7.15  Legend suggest third panel has a smooth that fits the original data.  It actually smooths as in panel 2.  This is exactly the way the code on p.134 draws it, though, so I guess we would say the legend not the panel is wrong.
p. 136, figure 8.9b.  When I execulte the code, the viewport figure as written still covers the points of plot b unlike shown in the figure.  The figure appears to also include a change in viewport origin not included in sample code.  Is there a missing redifinition of subvp?

From Stefan Schreiber
p. 101, 2nd bullet:
For 14/10/1979 to be displayed the format should be “%d/%m/%Y”. In the book it looks like a lower case ‘y’.
p. 143, Table 8.1: Theme elements.
It says that the theme elements axis.text.x and axis.text.y control the axis labels, and axis.title.x and axis.title.y control the tick labels. I believe it is the other way around (also when considering Fig. 6.12: The components of the axes and legend).

From Raymond Balise
 Page 79 assault and murder should be Assault and Murder
 The code for pages 82 and 83 is not included in the book
 page 84 the first code block is missing the code to make the m2 dataset.  I think this is what you did to make m2:
 m2 <- ggplot(movies, aes(x = round(rating), y = log10(votes)))
 page 84 the second code block is missing the code to make the m dataset.  I think this is what you did to make m:
 m <- ggplot(movies, aes(x = year, y = rating))
 page 124 the code for the left panel of the plot is not included in the book.  I got it by tweaking the mpg3 dataset as follows:
 mpg3 <- within(mpg2, {
  model <- reorder(as.character(model), cty)
  manufacturer <- reorder(manufacturer, -cty)
 })
 models <- qplot(cty, model, data = mpg3)
 models
 page 125 has a comma where a decimal point belongs:
 xmaj <- c(.3, .5, 1,3, 5) should be xmaj <- c(.3, .5, 1.3, 5)
 While not really a typo... the American spelling of the word colour on the last line of page 125 does not work.

From Carson Sievert:
  First paragraph of scales chapter: should "the range of the range" be "the range of the _scale_"?
