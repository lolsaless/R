ggplot2 is a new data visualisation package for R that uses the insights from Leland Wilkison's Grammar of Graphics to create a powerful and flexible system for creating data graphics. Practically, \ggplot provides beautiful, hassle-free plots, that take care of fiddly details like drawing legends. A carefully chosen set of defaults means that most of the time you can toss-off a publication-quality graphic in seconds, but you if do have special formatting requirements, a comprehensive theming system makes it easy to do what you want. Instead of spending time making your graph look pretty, you can focus on creating a graph that bests reveals the messages in your data.

This book will be useful to everyone who has struggled with displaying their data in an informative and attractive way. You will need some basic knowledge of R (i.e. you should be able to get your data in R), but ggplot2 is a mini-language specifically tailored for producing graphics, and you'll learn everything you need in the book. After reading this book you'll be able to produce graphics customised precisely for your problems, to and you'll find it easy to get graphics out of your head and on to the screen or page.

Hadley Wickham is an Assistant Professor of Statistics at Rice University, and is interested in developing tools (both computational and cognitive) for making data preparation, visualisation and analysis easier. He has developed 15 R packages and in 2006 he won the John Chambers Award for Statistical Computing for his work on the ggplot and reshape R packages.

This book describes ggplot2, a plotting system for R.  R is an open-source statistical computing environment that is very popular in the academic statistics community, and is increasingly used in other areas of academia and industry.  ggplot2 is a add on package for data visualisation.  It provides you with the tools to make pretty much any type of data visualisation that you can imagine, using a consistent syntax that is easy to learn.

> Please supply three unique selling points that we can present in
> bulleted form on our web page. 

* Provides both rich theory and powerful applications.

* All figures are accompanied by the code required to produce them.  This makes it easier to see an interesting plot and modify it for your own data.

* Full-colour figures are visually interesting, and useful one of the most powerful aspects of human vision: colour perception.



> Please supply a maximum of five key words/phrases for your book. We will
> make them available to search engines such as Springer.com and
> Amazon.com.

* Grammar of Graphics
* Data graphics
* Statistical graphics
* Visualisation
* R



> What is the main competing book and what advantages does your book
> offer?

* Lattice, by Deepayan Sarkar.  This is competing in the sense that the underlying graphics systems (lattice and ggplot2) are competing.  I would expect many people interested in R graphics to buy both books.  I would claim ggplot2 is more useful in the long run because you less limited in the types of plots you can produce.

It is complementary to:

* R Graphics, by Paul Murrell, which describes the lower-level details of the drawing system used by ggplot2

* The Grammar of Graphics, by Lee Wilkinson, which goes into more detail about the theory behind ggplot2.



> Your book will be advertised to the main statistical societies. Please
> list any other societies that are an important market for your book.

IEEE - esp. infovis community

> What supplementary material will be available? If you have exercise
> sets, will you be able to supply answers/solutions/hints for instructors
> that require the book for a course?

ggplot2 website provides:

 * over 400 examples of ggplot2 plots, with code required to produce them
 * all code used in book
