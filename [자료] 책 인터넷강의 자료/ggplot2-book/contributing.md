# Contributing

This book will be updated in the open, and it wouldn't be nearly as good without your contributions. There are a number of ways you can help make the book even better:

* If thereâ€™s a particular section of the book that you think needs an update (or is just plain missing), please let us know by filing an [issue](https://github.com/hadley/ggplot2-book/issues).

* Submit a pull request including a brief description of your changes: 
  fixing typos is perfectly adequate.

* If you make significant changes, include the phrase "I assign the copyright of this contribution to Hadley Wickham" - I need this so I can publish the printed book.

* If you don't understand something, please [let me know](mailto:h.wickham@gmail.com). Your feedback on what is confusing or hard to understand is valuable.
