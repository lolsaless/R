# R이란 무엇인가?

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## 인터렉티브 그래프

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r plotly, message=FALSE}
library(plotly)
library(ggplot2)

p <- ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy, color = drv)) + geom_point()

ggplotly(p)

a <- ggplot(diamonds, aes(cut, fill = clarity)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge")

ggplotly(a)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
